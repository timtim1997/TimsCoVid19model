# TimsCoVid19model

So I'm trying to make a COVID 19 Model. First I did the regular SIR model and it worked fine. I'm trying to add layers of complexity to it 
---> Time component (lags, incubation, different infection rates)
---> Different measures and effects
---> dierent effects on different age populations

----> NEXT LEVEL, different interactions between groups (workplaces, schools etc.,)
